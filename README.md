# theyDontReallyCareAboutUS

Turning ignored complaints into inescapable actions.
TheyMustCareAboutUS is the nervous system your institution never had. It transforms student grievances from whispers into visible, timed reflexes that force real responses.

🏥 The Problem: Institutions Without Nerves
Picture a college as a living creature. It has ears—suggestion boxes, emails, Google Forms—but no nerves. Pain goes in. Nothing twitches. Nothing reacts. The body never feels it.
Today, a student's grievance ("Something wrong happened to me inside this institution") can simply disappear into a bureaucratic black hole. Silence breeds frustration, cynicism, and worse—unaddressed harassment, delays, or discrimination that festers.
TheyMustCareAboutUS changes that. It's not just a website. It's a reflex. Every complaint becomes an object that cannot be ignored: tracked, timed, and escalated automatically.

💡 The Solution: A Reflex, Not a Request
When a student submits a grievance, TheyMustCareAboutUS does three things immediately:

Assigns a Permanent ID: Your voice gets a unique, unerasable tag.
Enters a Public Queue: Visible to all—transparency without exposure.
Starts a Clock: Deadlines that measure silence.

From there, the system enforces accountability through escalation, amplification, and exposure.
Key Features

Social Amplification
Peers can mark "This affects me too"—not likes or upvotes, but a collective signal. Isolated issues stay low; widespread problems climb in priority, surfacing systemic failures.
Auto-Escalation: Time as a Weapon
Every grievance has a response deadline. Miss it? It automatically escalates:
Level 1: Department head
Level 2: Dean/Vice-Chancellor
Level 3: Highest authority (e.g., Provost)
No reminders. No begging. Silence pushes it up the ladder.

In One Sentence
TheyMustCareAboutUS turns ignored complaints into timed obligations that climb the power ladder until someone with real authority is forced to act. It's not louder. It's inescapable.
